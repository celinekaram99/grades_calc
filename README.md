## :heavy_division_sign: Using the Calculator

The application allows the user to enter the final grades and the user determines how many grades he have.  The user then enters their scores for each subject and after that the application calculates the grade average

The user interface is built using EJS and is rendered on the server using a render server such as Pug, Mustache, or Handlebars.
